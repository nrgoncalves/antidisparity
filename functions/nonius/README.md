# nonius
A collection of tools to work with binocular eye tracking data

## Install

Clone this repository and place it in a folder covered by your MATLAB path.

## Dependencies

These tools require Matlab. So far, this toolbox was only tested under version 2017a, but it should be compatible with earlier versions.

We also rely on shadedErrorBar.m (https://github.com/raacampbell/shadedErrorBar) to plot mean and standard deviation across experimental trials.

## Examples

The easiest way to get started is to look at the example scripts `Example1.m` and `Example2.m`, as well as the MAT files in the `sample-data` folder.

## Documentation

Documentation is provided under the `doc` folder in this repository (`doc/index.html`). This is still very incomplete but will be updated regularly.
